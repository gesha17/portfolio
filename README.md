## Intro

Smart contract security researcher since 2024. Prior to that I have ~8 years experience writing code in web2. I am a strong believer in DeFi and find it very fulfilling to be able to contribute for a better future :)

I have found 25+ H/M bugs in audit contests including 1 solo medium severity bug.
